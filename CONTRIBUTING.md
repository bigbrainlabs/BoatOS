## How Can I Contribute?

### üêõ Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report, please check existing [Issues](https://github.com/bigbrainlabs/BoatOS/issues) to avoid duplicates.

**Good bug reports include:**
- **Clear title** - "GPS tracking stops after 2 hours"

**Example:**
```markdown
**Title:** GPS tracking stops after 2 hours of operation

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Start BoatOS

### üí° Suggesting Features

We love new ideas! Before suggesting a feature:
1. Check [existing issues](https://github.com/bigbrainlabs/BoatOS/issues) and [TODO.md](TODO.md) (if you have local access)
2. Consider if it fits BoatOS's mission (marine navigation for sailors)
3. Think about implementation complexity

**Good feature requests include:**
- **Use case** - Why do you need this?

- **Alternatives** - Did you consider other approaches?
- **Mockups** - Screenshots or sketches (optional but helpful!)

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Raspberry Pi 4/5** (or x86 Linux for development)
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Git**
- **Basic knowledge of:** Python (FastAPI), JavaScript, HTML/CSS

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub (click "Fork" button)

# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/BoatOS.git
cd BoatOS
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# System packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-venv python3-pip nginx git

# Backend setup
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend (no build step required - vanilla JS)
cd ../frontend
# Just serve with nginx or http-server
```

### 3. Configuration

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your API keys (optional for development)
nano .env
```

### 4. Run Development Server

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python app/main.py
# Runs on http://localhost:8000
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
# Simple HTTP server (Python)
python3 -m http.server 3000
# Or use nginx config from install.sh
```

**Access:** http://localhost:3000 (or 8000 for API only)

### 5. Run with SignalK (GPS testing)

```bash
# Install SignalK (for GPS/NMEA integration)
npm install -g signalk-server
signalk-server
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python (Backend)

**Style:** Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/)

```python
# Good
def calculate_distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):
    """Calculate distance between two coordinates in nautical miles.

    Args:
        lat1, lon1: First coordinate
        lat2, lon2: Second coordinate

    Returns:
        float: Distance in nautical miles
    """
    # Implementation
    pass

# Bad
def calc_dist(l1,l2,l3,l4):
    # no docstring
    pass
```

**Formatting:**
- 4 spaces for indentation
- Max line length: 120 characters
- Use type hints when possible
- Docstrings for all functions

### JavaScript (Frontend)

**Style:** Modern ES6+

```javascript
// Good
async function fetchGPSData() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('/api/gps');
        const data = await response.json();
        updateMap(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('GPS fetch failed:', error);
        showError('Could not fetch GPS data');
    }
}

// Bad
function fetchGPSData() {
    fetch('/api/gps').then(function(response) {
        return response.json();
    }).then(function(data) {
        updateMap(data);
    }).catch(function(error) {
        console.log(error); // Don't just log, handle it!
    });
}
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use `const` and `let`, not `var`
- Use async/await over Promises
- Handle errors properly
- Add comments for complex UI logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### HTML/CSS

```html
<!-- Good -->
<button class="btn btn-primary" id="start-tracking" aria-label="Start GPS tracking">
    Start Tracking
</button>

<!-- Bad -->
<button onclick="start()" style="background:blue;color:white">Start</button>
```

**Guidelines:**
- Semantic HTML (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`)
- Accessibility (ARIA labels, alt text)
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Use CSS classes, not inline styles
- BEM naming convention for CSS
